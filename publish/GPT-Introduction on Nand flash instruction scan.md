# GPT-Introduction on Nand flash instruction scan

Nand flash is a type of non-volatile memory that stores data by changing the electrical charge of cells arranged in a grid. In this blog post, we will explore the structure of Nand flash, how it executes instructions, and how to scan its instruction set.

## 1. What's the structure of Nand flash?

Nand flash consists of two main components: the memory array and the controller. The memory array is composed of blocks, which are further divided into pages. Each page contains a number of cells that store bits of data. The controller is responsible for managing the communication between the memory array and the external device, such as a computer or a smartphone.

### 1.1 Does it have a controller to send out instructions?

Yes, Nand flash has a controller that sends out instructions to the memory array. These instructions are specific to each Nand flash manufacturer and model, and they control how the data is read, written, erased, or modified in the memory cells.

#### 1.1.1 What's the difference between Nand flash instruction and ISA, like x86, RISCV, ARM?

Nand flash instruction and ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) are different concepts. ISA is a set of rules and conventions that define how a processor operates and executes instructions. Nand flash instruction is a set of commands that control how a Nand flash device operates and accesses data. ISA is designed for general-purpose computing, while Nand flash instruction is designed for specific memory operations.

#### 1.1.2 Is nand flash's instruction more confidencial than common ISA?

Nand flash's instruction is more confidential than common ISA because it is not standardized or publicly documented by the manufacturers. Each Nand flash device may have a different instruction set that is only known to the manufacturer and the customers who use it. This makes it harder for outsiders to reverse engineer or modify the Nand flash device.

### 1.2 Can a Nand flash be programed to run specific program?

No, Nand flash cannot be programmed to run specific program like a processor can. Nand flash is a memory device that only stores and retrieves data according to the instructions from the controller. It does not have the ability to execute arbitrary code or perform complex calculations.

#### 1.2.1 If so, how to make the specific program run in the Nand flash?

This question is not applicable because Nand flash cannot run specific program.

## 2. What is instruction scan?

Instruction scan is a technique that aims to identify and analyze the instruction set of a device or a system. It involves sending various inputs to the device or system and observing its outputs or behaviors. By comparing the inputs and outputs, one can infer what instructions are supported by the device or system and how they work.

### 2.1 What's the main purpose of instruction scan?

The main purpose of instruction scan is to understand how a device or system operates and interacts with other components. For example, instruction scan can be used to reverse engineer the functionality of an unknown device, to find vulnerabilities or bugs in a system, or to optimize the performance or compatibility of a software.

#### 2.1.1 Does the purpose of instruction scan varies, depending on the target is nand flash or ISA?

Yes, the purpose of instruction scan varies depending on whether the target is nand flash or ISA. For nand flash, instruction scan can be used to reveal the hidden features or commands of the device, to bypass security mechanisms or encryption schemes, or to modify or clone the data stored in the device. For ISA, instruction scan can be used to discover undocumented or unused instructions, to test the correctness or robustness of the processor, or to exploit potential weaknesses or backdoors in the processor.

#### 2.1.2 If so, what is the purpose correspondingly?

This question is already answered in 2.1.1.

### 2.2 How do existing works implement instruction scan on nand flash?

Existing works implement instruction scan on nand flash by using various methods and tools, such as logic analyzers, oscilloscopes, microcontrollers, software libraries, or custom hardware devices. These methods and tools allow them to capture and analyze the signals between the controller and the memory array, and to send and receive instructions to and from the nand flash device.

#### 2.2.1 What is the difference between nand flash and ISA instruction scan?

The difference between nand flash and ISA instruction scan is that nand flash instruction scan requires accessing the physical interface of the device and manipulating its electrical signals directly, while ISA instruction scan can be done through software emulation or simulation without modifying the hardware.

#### 2.2.2 If the main purpose is to reverse nand flash instruction, how to do that?

To reverse nand flash instruction, one needs to perform instruction scan on nand flash by following these steps:

- Identify the type and model of nand flash device
- Find out its pinout and protocol specifications
- Connect it to an appropriate hardware or software tool that can send and receive instructions
- Send various inputs to nand flash device and observe its outputs
- Compare inputs and outputs with known instructions or patterns
- Infer unknown instructions or parameters based on inputs and outputs
- Repeat until all instructions are identified

#### 2.2.3 If the main purpose is to determine nand flash instruction, it's the same as 2.1?

Yes, if the main purpose is to determine nand flash instruction, it's essentially the same as reverse engineering nand flash instruction as described in 2.2.2.

#### 2.2.4 If a scan program was used to scan nand flash instruction, would it be processed within or without Nand flash?

If a scan program was used to scan nand flash instruction, it would be processed without Nand flash because Nand flash cannot execute arbitrary code as explained in 1.2.
