> **Rewrite "**Integrated Outline:** 1. **Initialize GStreamer and create a pipeline**: Start by initializing the GStreamer library and creating a new pipeline object. This pipeline will serve as the backbone of the server application, allowing you to link together various elements to handle audio and video processing. 2. **Set up communication with clients**: Add elements to the pipeline to handle communication with multiple clients using the supported communication protocols (RTP, RTSP, RTMP). This will involve setting up a server component that can accept incoming connections from clients and manage the distribution of audio and video data to each client. 3. **Implement encoding and multi-bitrate video conversion**: Add elements to the pipeline to encode the input audio and video data using the H.264/H.265 codecs, and convert the video to multiple bitrates. This will allow the server application to dynamically adjust the bitrate of the video streams sent to each client based on their network conditions and Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. 4. **Handle client requests for on-demand content**: Implement support for handling client requests for on-demand content, such as asynchronous playback of stored audio and video files. This will involve adding capabilities to the server application for managing stored content and serving it to clients upon request. 5. **Create a command-line interface**: Develop a command-line interface for controlling the server application. This interface will allow users to start and stop the server, as well as adjust various settings such as the communication protocol, video resolution, and bitrate. **Possible File Structure:** ``` server/ ├── src/ │ ├── main.c │ ├── pipeline.c │ ├── pipeline.h │ ├── server.c │ ├── server.h │ ├── encoder.c │ ├── encoder.h │ ├── content_manager.c │ └── content_manager.h ├── Makefile └── README.md ```" in style of "**Server side outline**: * The server program would have a main function that sets up the GStreamer pipeline and starts the main loop. * The pipeline would consist of several components, including a network component for receiving data from clients, a storage component for saving data to disk, and a playback component for sending data to clients. * The network component would use `appsrc` and `appsink` elements to receive data from clients and send it to the storage component. * The storage component would use `filesink` and `filesrc` elements to save and retrieve data from disk.

*   The client component would establish a connection with the server and receive audio and video data.
*   The decoding component would select appropriate decoder elements for the H.264/H.265 codecs.
