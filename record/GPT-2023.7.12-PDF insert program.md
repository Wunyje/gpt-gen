> **There is a requirement of implementing a sofware " This software coded in *Python* can auxiliarily insert bookmarks or outlines for PDF ebook. * Main function: * * 1 Extract the table of the content about the ebook, get the raw text about titles and page number. * * * 1.1 For photocopy PDF, use OCR to scan out the table of the content. * * * 1.2 For pure text PDF, copy the table of the content out of the PDF files. * * 2 Modify the raw text about table of content, to generate a PDF file's outline in proper format. * * 3 Insert bookmarks with offset. " How would you do that? Tell your thought step by step.**

Here is a high-level overview of how I would approach implementing this software in Python:

1.  **Extract the table of contents**: Depending on the type of PDF (photocopy or pure text), I would use different methods to extract the table of contents. For photocopy PDFs, I would use an OCR library such as Tesseract or PyTesseract to scan the table of contents and extract the raw text. For pure text PDFs, I would use a PDF library such as PyPDF2 or pdfrw to extract the text directly from the PDF file.
    
2.  **Process the raw text**: Once I have the raw text of the table of contents, I would process it to extract the titles and page numbers. This could involve using regular expressions or string manipulation methods to identify and extract the relevant information.
    
3.  **Generate the outline**: With the titles and page numbers extracted, I would use a PDF library such as PyPDF2 or pdfrw to generate an outline in the proper format for the PDF file.
    
4.  **Insert bookmarks with offset**: Finally, I would use the same PDF library to insert bookmarks into the PDF file at the appropriate locations, taking into account any specified offset.
    

This is just a high-level overview of how I would approach this task. There are many details that would need to be worked out during implementation, such as how to handle different types of PDF files and how to accurately extract and process the table of contents. But this should give you a general idea of how to approach this task.

> **Give me the possible file composition and file structure under the rules of *High cohesion, low coupling*. Think step by step****

High cohesion and low coupling are important principles in software design that help to create modular, maintainable, and reusable code. Here is an example of how the file composition and structure of a Python project that follows these principles might look like:

```
my_project/
├── main.py
├── pdf_processor/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── extractor.py
│   ├── formatter.py
│   └── inserter.py
└── utils/
    ├── __init__.py
    └── ocr.py
```

In this example, the `main.py` file would contain the main logic of the program, such as parsing command-line arguments and coordinating the different components of the software.

The `pdf_processor` package would contain modules related to processing PDF files, such as extracting the table of contents (`extractor.py`), formatting the outline (`formatter.py`), and inserting bookmarks (`inserter.py`). Each module would have a specific, well-defined responsibility, leading to high cohesion within the package.

The `utils` package would contain utility modules that could be used by other parts of the program. In this case, it contains an `ocr.py` module that provides functionality for performing OCR on photocopy PDFs.

This structure promotes high cohesion by grouping related functionality into separate modules and packages. It also promotes low coupling by minimizing the dependencies between different parts of the program. For example, the `pdf_processor` package does not need to know about the details of how OCR is performed; it can simply use the functionality provided by the `ocr` module in the `utils` package.

Of course, this is just one possible way to structure a project that follows the principles of high cohesion and low coupling. The exact file composition and structure would depend on the specific requirements and design of the software.

> **Try to write the pseudo code of all the files of the program, revealing the dynamic invoking relationship between these files**

Here is an example of how the pseudo code for the different files in the `my_project` example from my previous message might look like, along with the dynamic invoking relationships between them:

`main.py`:

```python
import argparse
from pdf_processor import extractor, formatter, inserter

def main():
    # Parse command-line arguments
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument('pdf_file', help='Path to the PDF file')
    parser.add_argument('--offset', type=int, default=0, help='Bookmark offset')
    args = parser.parse_args()

    # Extract the table of contents
    toc = extractor.extract_toc(args.pdf_file)

    # Generate the outline
    outline = formatter.format_outline(toc)

    # Insert bookmarks
    inserter.insert_bookmarks(args.pdf_file, outline, args.offset)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

复制

`pdf_processor/extractor.py`:

```python
from utils import ocr
from PyPDF2 import PdfFileReader

def extract_toc(pdf_file):
    # Determine if the PDF is a photocopy or pure text
    if is_photocopy(pdf_file):
        # Use OCR to extract the table of contents
        toc = ocr.extract_text(pdf_file)
    else:
        # Extract the text directly from the PDF file
        with open(pdf_file, 'rb') as f:
            reader = PdfFileReader(f)
            toc = reader.getPage(0).extractText()

    return toc

def is_photocopy(pdf_file):
    # Implementation omitted for brevity
    pass
```

复制

`pdf_processor/formatter.py`:

```python
def format_outline(toc):
    # Process the raw text to extract titles and page numbers
    # Implementation omitted for brevity

    # Generate the outline in the proper format
    # Implementation omitted for brevity

    return outline
```

复制

`pdf_processor/inserter.py`:

```python
from PyPDF2 import PdfFileReader, PdfFileWriter

def insert_bookmarks(pdf_file, outline, offset):
    # Insert bookmarks into the PDF file at the appropriate locations
    # Implementation omitted for brevity
```

复制

`utils/ocr.py`:

```python
import pytesseract

def extract_text(image_file):
    # Use OCR to extract text from an image file
    text = pytesseract.image_to_string(image_file)
    return text
```

In this example, the `main.py` file coordinates the different components of the software by invoking functions from the `extractor`, `formatter`, and `inserter` modules in the `pdf_processor` package. These modules, in turn, may invoke functions from other modules or packages as needed. For example, the `extractor` module invokes the `extract_text` function from the `ocr` module in the `utils` package to perform OCR on photocopy PDFs.

This structure promotes loose coupling between different parts of the program by minimizing direct dependencies between modules. Instead of invoking functions from other modules directly, each module provides a well-defined interface that can be used by other parts of the program. This makes it easier to change or replace individual components without affecting other parts of the program.
