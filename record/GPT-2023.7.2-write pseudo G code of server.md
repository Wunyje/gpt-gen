> **Here is a more detailed outline of the server side of the application, along with a possible file structure: Server side outline: The server program would have a main function that sets up the GStreamer pipeline and starts the main loop. The pipeline would consist of several components, including a network component for receiving data from clients, a storage component for saving data to disk, and a playback component for sending data to clients. The network component would use appsrc and appsink elements to receive data from clients and send it to the storage component. The storage component would use filesink and filesrc elements to save and retrieve data from disk. It would be responsible for managing the on-disk storage of incoming streams. The playback component would use filesrc, decoding, encoding, and muxing elements to read data from disk, transcode it into the desired format, and send it to clients. It would support multiple communication protocols, such as RTP, RTSP, and RTMP. The server program would also include code for handling client requests, such as starting and stopping streams, seeking within streams, and adjusting playback parameters. Possible file structure: main.c: Contains the main function that sets up the GStreamer pipeline and starts the main loop. network.c: Contains code for the network component of the pipeline, including functions for receiving data from clients and sending it to the storage component. storage.c: Contains code for the storage component of the pipeline, including functions for saving and retrieving data from disk. playback.c: Contains code for the playback component of the pipeline, including functions for reading data from disk, transcoding it into the desired format, and sending it to clients. request_handler.c: Contains code for handling client requests, such as starting and stopping streams, seeking within streams, and adjusting playback parameters.**

Thank you for sharing the detailed outline of the server side of your application and the possible file structure. Is there anything specific you would like me to help with or provide more information on?

> **Try to code the `main.c` in pseudo-code**

Here is a possible pseudo-code for the `main.c` file:

```c
#include "network.h"
#include "storage.h"
#include "playback.h"
#include "request_handler.h"

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    // Initialize GStreamer
    gst_init(&argc, &argv);

    // Set up the GStreamer pipeline
    GstElement *pipeline = gst_pipeline_new("server-pipeline");
    GstElement *network = setup_network();
    GstElement *storage = setup_storage();
    GstElement *playback = setup_playback();

    gst_bin_add_many(GST_BIN(pipeline), network, storage, playback, NULL);
    gst_element_link_many(network, storage, playback, NULL);

    // Start the main loop
    GMainLoop *loop = g_main_loop_new(NULL, FALSE);
    g_main_loop_run(loop);

    // Clean up
    gst_element_set_state(pipeline, GST_STATE_NULL);
    gst_object_unref(pipeline);
    g_main_loop_unref(loop);

    return 0;
}
```

This is just a rough outline and would need to be filled in with more details and specific function calls. Is there anything else you would like me to help with?

> **How does the request handler work?**

The request handler is responsible for handling client requests, such as starting and stopping streams, seeking within streams, and adjusting playback parameters. It would contain code for parsing and interpreting client requests, and then calling the appropriate functions in the network, storage, and playback components to carry out the requested actions.

Here is an example of how the request handler might work in pseudo-code:

```c
#include "request_handler.h"
#include "network.h"
#include "storage.h"
#include "playback.h"

void handle_request(char *request) {
    // Parse the request
    RequestType type = parse_request_type(request);
    RequestData data = parse_request_data(request);

    // Handle the request
    switch (type) {
        case START_STREAM:
            start_stream(data.stream_id);
            break;
        case STOP_STREAM:
            stop_stream(data.stream_id);
            break;
        case SEEK_STREAM:
            seek_stream(data.stream_id, data.position);
            break;
        case ADJUST_PLAYBACK:
            adjust_playback(data.stream_id, data.playback_rate);
            break;
        // ...
    }
}

void start_stream(int stream_id) {
    // Call the appropriate functions in the network, storage, and playback components
    network_start_stream(stream_id);
    storage_start_stream(stream_id);
    playback_start_stream(stream_id);
}

// ...
```

> **So, the `request_handler` is basically the core component to make other function, including `network`, `storage`, `playback`, run dynamicly? And which part of `main.c` has shown that?**

Yes, the `request_handler` is responsible for interpreting client requests and calling the appropriate functions in the `network`, `storage`, and `playback` components to carry out the requested actions.

In the pseudo-code I provided earlier for `main.c`, the `request_handler` was not explicitly shown. However, it could be integrated into the main loop of the server program, where it would listen for incoming client requests and call the `handle_request` function to process them. Here is an example of how this might look in pseudo-code:

```c
#include "network.h"
#include "storage.h"
#include "playback.h"
#include "request_handler.h"

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    // Initialize GStreamer
    gst_init(&argc, &argv);

    // Set up the GStreamer pipeline
    GstElement *pipeline = gst_pipeline_new("server-pipeline");
    GstElement *network = setup_network();
    GstElement *storage = setup_storage();
    GstElement *playback = setup_playback();

    gst_bin_add_many(GST_BIN(pipeline), network, storage, playback, NULL);
    gst_element_link_many(network, storage, playback, NULL);

    // Start the main loop
    GMainLoop *loop = g_main_loop_new(NULL, FALSE);

    // Listen for incoming client requests
    while (TRUE) {
        char *request = listen_for_request();
        handle_request(request);
    }

    g_main_loop_run(loop);

    // Clean up
    gst_element_set_state(pipeline, GST_STATE_NULL);
    gst_object_unref(pipeline);
    g_main_loop_unref(loop);

    return 0;
}
```
